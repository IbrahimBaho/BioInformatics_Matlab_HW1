# BioInformatics_Matlab_HW1

This is program is an intro to bioinformatics, in this homework we write couple of functions in MATLAB to do:

A)
1- getReverseComp that takes a string as a DNA sequence and return its reverse complementary strand.
2- findStartCodon that takes a string as a DNA sequence, and returns the indices of all possible start codons.
3- findStopCodon that takes a string as a DNA sequence, and returns the indices of all possible stop codons.
4- findLongestORF that takes as input a DNA sequence, and returns the longest ORF.

B)
Use MATLAB to implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with m = 1, s = -1, d = -1. The input and output of your function should be as follows.
Input: two DNA sequence strings.
Output:
- the optimal global alignment score between the two sequences.
- the number of matched characters
-  the number of mismatched characters
-  the number of insertion / deletions in the alignment.

to run this program, simply use the q2script.m and q4scropt.m, where q2 in the first part (A) and q4 is the second (B).
